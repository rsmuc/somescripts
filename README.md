In this repository are some personal scripts. Don't expect too much.

Usage: Copy all scripts to one folder and just run the ./run.sh script.

First the script will search for empty pages in PDF files and will remove them. The empty pages will be stored in a seperate file and a copy of the original file will be kept.

The second step is OCR with ocrmypdf.

And last but not least all PDFs in the folder will be verified with veraPDF.
